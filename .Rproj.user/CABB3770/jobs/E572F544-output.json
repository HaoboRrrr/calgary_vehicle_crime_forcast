This study examines trends in vehicle-related crime in Calgary, Canada, focusing on two types of crime: Theft of vehicle and Theft from vehicle. A Bayesian regression model is fit to historical crime data from January 2018 to October 2024, accounting for seasonal variations (months), long-term trends (years), and differences between crime categories. The usefulness of Bayesian modeling for crime trend forecasting is demonstrated by this analysis, providing law enforcement and policymakers practical insights to foresee and handle long-term and seasonal crime trends.'\n  bibliography:\n    - references.bib\n  \n"]
